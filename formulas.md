# Formula Parameter Definitions

## Operational Time — t

`t`

represents operational time.

Operationally:

- `t` defines the temporal evolution of structural dynamics, endogenous structural coherence, dissipation, self-organization, parameter drift, and dynamic stability over time.

## Operational Time Horizon — T

`T`

represents a finite operational time horizon.

Definition:

`T = t₁ − t₀`

Where:

- `t₀` — initial moment of operational time;

## System State — X(t)

`X(t)`

represents the operational state of the system at time `t`.

Operationally:

- `X(t)` describes the measurable dynamic configuration of the system.

Constraint:

`X(t) ∈ ℝⁿ`

## Synthesis of Positive Structural Work — S(t)

`S(t)`

represents the instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work at time `t`.

Operationally:

- `S(t)` influences the formation, maintenance, and reinforcement of structural integrity, self-organization, and general endogenous structural coherence of the system over time.

Examples:

- structural growth;
- adaptive restructuring;
- knowledge accumulation;
- operational organization;
- formation of organized structure;
- maintenance of structural integrity;
- synthesis of positive structural work.

Constraint:

`S(t) ≥ 0`

## Accumulated Positive Structural Work — W_S(T)

`W_S(T)`

represents accumulated positive structural work over the operational time horizon `T`.

Definition:

`W_S(T) = ∫[t₀ → t₁] S(t) dt`

Where:

- `W_S(T)` — accumulated positive structural work over interval `T`;
- `S(t)` — instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work;
- `t₀` — initial moment of operational time;
- `t₁` — final moment of operational time.

Operationally:

- `W_S(T)` describes the accumulated result of positive structural work synthesized over operational time;
- `W_S(T)` may support structural integrity, self-organization, and endogenous structural coherence;
- `W_S(T)` does not replace the criterion of real dynamic stability `C(t) > P(t)`.

## Destabilizing Structural Pressure — P(t)

`P(t)`

represents destabilizing structural pressure, fragmentation pressure, destabilizing extraction, overload, or operational destabilization at time `t`.

Operationally:

- `P(t)` describes processes that reduce structural integrity, increase fragmentation, and weaken dynamic stability over time.

Examples:

- fragmentation pressure;
- destabilizing operational stress;
- recursive overload;
- structural destabilization;
- destabilizing extraction;
- degradation pressure.

Constraint:

`P(t) ≥ 0`

## Irreversible Structural Losses — D(t)

`D(t)`

represents irreversible structural losses and entropy-producing degradation at time `t`.

Operationally:

- `D(t)` describes losses that cannot be fully restored through endogenous regenerative processes.

Examples:

- entropy production;
- irreversible degradation;
- unrecoverable structural losses;
- operational collapse channels;
- irreversible dissipation.

Constraint:

`D(t) ≥ 0`

## Instantaneous Structural Balance — Δ(t)

`Δ(t)`

represents instantaneous structural balance.

Definition:

`Δ(t) = S(t) − P(t) − D(t)`

Where:

- `Δ(t)` — instantaneous structural balance at time `t`;
- `S(t)` — instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work at time `t`;
- `P(t)` — destabilizing structural pressure at time `t`;
- `D(t)` — irreversible structural losses at time `t`;
- `t` — operational time variable.

Interpretation:

- `Δ(t) > 0` → positive structural formation balance;
- `Δ(t) = 0` → quasi-stationary operational balance;
- `Δ(t) < 0` → structural degradation and fragmentation.

Positive `Δ(t)` indicates formal structural existence.

It does not by itself prove real dynamic stability over time.

## Accumulated Structural Balance

Accumulated structural balance over the operational time horizon `T` is defined as:

`∫[t₀ → t₁] Δ(t) dt = ∫[t₀ → t₁] [S(t) − P(t) − D(t)] dt`

Operationally:

- positive accumulated structural balance supports formal structural existence over the evaluated operational time horizon;
- it does not by itself guarantee real dynamic stability if `C(t) ≤ P(t)`.

## Endogenous Structural Coherence — C(t)

`C(t)`

represents the parameter of general endogenous structural coherence that determines the level of structural integrity and dynamic stability over time.

Operationally:

- `C(t)` describes the measure of coherence of internal processes of structural self-organization, on which structural integrity and dynamic stability of the system over time depend.

Structural regeneration is a continuous endogenous process of restoring and maintaining structural integrity and coherence over time.

Regeneration supports `C(t)`, but is not identical to `C(t)`.

If endogenous processes are decoherent in phase, amplitude, accumulation rate, connection quality, or functional contribution, the structure loses the capacity to regenerate structural integrity faster than dissipation destroys it.

A decrease of `C(t)` means a decrease of general endogenous structural coherence, where destabilizing pressure begins to exceed the structure’s capacity for self-regeneration over time.

Examples:

- coherent internal self-organization;
- retained structural integrity;
- regenerative capacity as a supporting process;
- coherent subsystem contribution to the whole system;
- resistance to fragmentation;
- retention of dynamic stability over time.

Constraint:

`C(t) ≥ 0`

## Operational Coupling Factor — K(t)

`K(t)`

represents an optional operational coupling factor describing the degree to which measurable synchronization or coupling effects support effective synthesis of positive structural work or reduce effective dissipation.

Operationally:

- `K(t)` may modulate effective synthesis of positive structural work and effective irreversible losses under measurable coupling conditions.

Constraint:

`K(t) ∈ (0,1]`

Important distinction:

`K(t)` must not be equated with `C(t)`.

Synchronization or coupling may support endogenous structural coherence, but they do not define it.

## Effective Synthesis of Positive Structural Work — S_eff

`S_eff`

represents effective synthesis of positive structural work under operational coupling conditions.

Definition:

`S_eff = K(t) · S(t)`

Where:

- `S_eff` — effective synthesis of positive structural work;
- `K(t)` — operational coupling factor;
- `S(t)` — instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work.

Operational interpretation:

- measurable coupling may increase the effective accessibility of synthesis of positive structural work;
- this does not by itself prove real dynamic stability over time.

## Effective Irreversible Structural Losses — D_eff

`D_eff`

represents effective irreversible structural losses under operational coupling conditions.

Definition:

`D_eff = D(t) / K(t)`

Where:

- `D_eff` — effective irreversible structural losses;
- `D(t)` — irreversible structural losses;
- `K(t)` — operational coupling factor.

Operational interpretation:

- loss of effective coupling may increase the impact of irreversible structural losses;
- this does not replace the primary EDS criterion `C(t) > P(t)`.

## Operational Observable — O

`O`

represents a measurable operational observable quantity.

Operationally:

- `O` may describe macroscopic operational behavior of the system.

## Averaged Operational Observable — ⟨O⟩

`⟨O⟩`

represents an averaged operational observable.

Operationally:

- `⟨O⟩` is used to describe quasi-stationary observable regimes.

## Operational Jacobian — J

`J`

represents the local operational Jacobian matrix.

Definition:

`J = ∂F/∂X`

Operationally:

- `J` describes local sensitivity of operational dynamics to perturbations.

## Eigenvalues — λ_i

`λ_i`

represent eigenvalues of the operational Jacobian.

Operational interpretation:

- eigenvalues describe local stability accessibility near a given operational regime.

## Operational Lyapunov Functional — V(X)

`V(X)`

represents an operational Lyapunov-like stability functional.

Operationally:

- `V(X)` measures operational stability accessibility and boundedness of trajectories.

Constraint:

`V(X) ≥ 0`

## Operational Parameter — μ

`μ`

represents an operational control parameter influencing dynamic accessibility, critical transition, and bifurcation formation.

## Stochastic Fluctuation Intensity — σ

`σ`

represents stochastic fluctuation intensity within operational stochastic dynamics.

## Wiener Process Increment — dW_t

`dW_t`

represents an infinitesimal stochastic Wiener process increment.

Operationally:

- `dW_t` models stochastic perturbations affecting operational dynamics.

## Regenerative Recovery Resource — R(t)

`R(t)`

represents regenerative recovery resources available to the system at time `t`.

Operationally:

- `R(t)` may contribute to restoration of structural integrity and support of endogenous structural coherence;
- `R(t)` may support `C(t)`, but does not replace `C(t)`.

## Critical Recovery Threshold — R_crit

`R_crit`

represents the minimum regenerative recovery threshold required for retained operational continuity.

# 1. Fundamental Operational Dynamics

Let:

`X(t) ∈ ℝⁿ`

denote the operational state of the system at time `t`.

Operational structural dynamics are defined as:

`dX/dt = F(X,t)`

where `F(X,t)` describes the system-relative vector field of the operational dynamics.

The scalar instantaneous structural balance is defined separately as:

`Δ(t) = S(t) − P(t) − D(t)`

Where:

- `S(t)` — instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work;
- `P(t)` — destabilizing structural pressure;
- `D(t)` — irreversible structural losses;
- `t` — operational time variable.

Operational interpretation:

- `X(t)` is the vector state of the system;
- `Δ(t)` is the scalar instantaneous structural balance;
- `Δ(t)` describes formal structural balance;
- positive `Δ(t)` supports formal structural existence;
- `Δ(t)` alone does not prove real dynamic stability over time.

# 2. Structural Existence Conditions

## Local Structural Existence

Formal structural existence remains locally accessible if:

`Δ(t) ≥ δ > 0`

Where:

- `δ` — minimum positive structural surplus required for retained formal structural existence.

Operational interpretation:

- the system preserves positive structural formation balance;
- this does not by itself prove real dynamic stability over time.

## Integral Structural Existence

Over a finite operational time horizon:

`∫_0^T (S(t) − P(t) − D(t))dt > 0`

Where:

- `T` — operational time horizon;
- `∫` — accumulation over operational time.

Operational interpretation:

- accumulated structural balance remains positive over the given time horizon;
- formal structural existence remains accessible;
- real dynamic stability still requires `C(t) > P(t)`.

## Accumulated Positive Structural Work

Accumulated positive structural work over the same operational time horizon is defined as:

`W_S(T) = ∫_0^T S(t)dt`

Operational interpretation:

- `W_S(T)` is the accumulated result of the synthesis of positive structural work over operational time;
- `W_S(T)` may support structural integrity, self-organization, and endogenous structural coherence;
- `W_S(T)` is not identical to `C(t)`;
- accumulated positive structural work does not replace the EDS criterion `C(t) > P(t)`.

# 3. Dynamic Stability Criterion

Real dynamic stability over time requires:

`C(t) > P(t)`

Where:

- `C(t)` — parameter of general endogenous structural coherence determining the level of structural integrity and dynamic stability over time;
- `P(t)` — destabilizing structural pressure.

Operational relation:

- general endogenous structural coherence exceeds destabilizing structural pressure over operational time.

Operational interpretation:

- the system remains dynamically stable over time while general endogenous structural coherence exceeds destabilizing structural pressure;
- if `C(t) ≤ P(t)`, the system may still preserve formal structural existence, but its real dynamic stability over time is already disrupted.

## Stability Margin

A retained dynamically stable regime with positive coherence surplus may be expressed as:

`C(t) ≥ P(t) + ε`

Where:

- `ε > 0` — minimum positive surplus of endogenous structural coherence over destabilizing structural pressure required for retained dynamic stability over time.

Operational interpretation:

- `ε` is not the same as `δ`;
- `δ` belongs to positive structural balance `Δ(t) ≥ δ > 0`;
- `ε` belongs to the dynamic stability margin `C(t) ≥ P(t) + ε`.

# 4. Dynamic Operational Equilibrium

Quasi-balanced operational regimes satisfy:

`S(t) ≈ P(t) + D(t)`

Operational interpretation:

- instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work approximately compensates destabilizing pressure and irreversible losses;
- this may describe quasi-stationary balance;
- it does not prove dynamic stability if `C(t) ≤ P(t)`.

# 5. Quasi-Stationary Observable Regime

Macroscopic operational observables may remain approximately stationary while internal dynamics continue:

`d⟨O⟩/dt ≈ 0`

Where:

- `O` — operational observable quantity;
- `⟨O⟩` — averaged operational observable.

Operational interpretation:

- external observable stability may coexist with ongoing internal restructuring;
- external stationarity does not prove internal dynamic stability over time.

# 6. Operational Coupling Mechanism

Let:

`K(t) ∈ (0,1]`

represent an optional operational coupling factor.

Then:

`S_eff = K(t) · S(t)`

`D_eff = D(t) / K(t)`

Where:

- `S_eff` — effective synthesis of positive structural work;
- `D_eff` — effective irreversible structural losses.

Operational interpretation:

- measurable synchronization or coupling may support effective synthesis of positive structural work;
- measurable synchronization or coupling may reduce effective dissipation propagation;
- synchronization or coupling does not by itself define endogenous structural coherence;
- `K(t)` must not be equated with `C(t)`.

# 7. Coherence and Synchronization Distinction

Synchronization means coincidence of processes in time, phase, or rhythm.

But synchronous work does not necessarily mean coherent work.

Synchronization of internal processes is not identical to their coherence:

- processes may coincide in time or phase;
- processes may differ in amplitude;
- processes may differ in direction of effort;
- processes may differ in function;
- processes may differ in contribution to the structural integrity of the whole system.

In EDS:

`C(t)`

describes not simple synchrony, but general endogenous structural coherence.

Operational interpretation:

- synchronization may be a partial mechanism or indicator;
- synchronization is not equal to `C(t)`;
- `C(t)` determines the level of structural integrity and dynamic stability over time.

# 8. Regeneration and C(t)

Structural regeneration is a continuous endogenous process of restoring and maintaining structural integrity and coherence over time.

Regeneration supports `C(t)`, but is not identical to `C(t)`.

If endogenous processes are decoherent in phase, amplitude, accumulation rate, connection quality, or functional contribution, the structure loses the capacity to regenerate structural integrity faster than dissipation destroys it.

Therefore:

decoherence of endogenous processes → reduction of regenerative capacity → dissipation exceeds regeneration → decrease of `C(t)` → disruption of dynamic stability over time.

Operational interpretation:

- regeneration is one of the internal processes supporting endogenous structural coherence;
- `C(t)` expresses the general level of endogenous structural coherence;
- when dissipation exceeds the structure’s capacity for self-regeneration over time, `C(t)` decreases.

# 9. Formal Transition Layer: From EDS to EDC

The following formulas are retained in this file as a transition layer from Endogenous Dynamic Stability (EDS) toward Endogenous Dynamic Criticality (EDC).

They are not the primary EDS criterion.

The primary EDS criterion remains:

`C(t) > P(t)`

where `C(t)` is the parameter of general endogenous structural coherence determining the level of structural integrity and dynamic stability over time.

The Jacobian, Lyapunov functional, bifurcation accessibility, stochastic dynamics, and scaling relations indicate the formal transition from stability analysis toward criticality, drift, and regime transition analysis.

In the full EDS/EDC repository, these layers are developed from the beginning as part of the complete framework.

# 10. Scaling Law

This section is retained as a transition point from EDS toward EDC.

It does not replace the primary EDS criterion:

`C(t) > P(t)`

Phenomenological scaling relations:

`S ∼ X^α`

`P ∼ X^β`

`D ∼ X^γ`

Operational structural balance at scale requires:

`α ≥ max(β, γ)`

Operational interpretation:

- instantaneous synthesis of positive structural work must scale at least as rapidly as destabilizing pressure and irreversible losses;
- this supports formal structural existence at scale;
- real dynamic stability still requires `C(t) > P(t)`.

## EDC Critical Ramp Scaling

Near the EDS–EDC boundary, the reduced scalar critical dynamics may be written as:

`dC/dt = v_eff t C − C³`

Introduce the canonical variables:

`C = v_eff^(1/4) y`

`t = v_eff^(−1/2) τ`

The reduced equation becomes:

`dy/dτ = τ y − y³`

Therefore:

`C_critical ~ v_eff^(1/4)`

`t_critical ~ v_eff^(−1/2)`

`t_delay ~ v_eff^(−1/2)`

The delay relation is the characteristic deterministic critical ramp scale of this reduced normal form. A measured or simulated transition delay may additionally depend on initial conditions, perturbation amplitude, noise, and the operational transition threshold.

For the adopted three-dimensional EDS interpretation, when `C` is treated as a characteristic linear coherence amplitude, the corresponding coherent volume obeys:

`V_coh ∝ C³`

This gives the cubic saturation term a volumetric interpretation. Spatial dimensionality alone does not determine the normal-form exponent; the interpretation must remain consistent with the definition of `C` and with the adopted scalar amplitude truncation.

# 11. Local Quasi-Linear Stability Approximation

Near a local operational regime:

`X*`

the dynamics may be locally approximated by:

`dξ/dt = J(X*) ξ`

where:

`J = ∂F/∂X`

represents the local operational Jacobian.

Local stability approximation remains operationally accessible if:

`Re(λ_i(J)) < 0`

for all eigenvalues:

`λ_i(J)`

Operational interpretation:

- sufficiently small perturbations decay locally near the operational regime;
- this describes local stability accessibility;
- it does not replace the EDS criterion `C(t) > P(t)`.

# 12. Lyapunov Operational Stability

Choose an operational Lyapunov-like functional:

`V(X) ≥ 0`

Then:

`dV/dt = ∇V · F(X)`

Operational stability remains locally accessible if:

`dV/dt ≤ 0`

Asymptotic operational stability remains accessible if:

`dV/dt < 0`

Operational interpretation:

- operational trajectories remain bounded or progressively stabilize over time;
- Lyapunov analysis supports local formal stability analysis;
- it does not replace the EDS criterion `C(t) > P(t)`.

# 13. Bifurcation Accessibility

At operational parameter:

`μ`

local stability changes when:

`Re(λ(μ_c)) = 0`

If additionally:

`Im(λ(μ_c)) ≠ 0`

then:

- oscillatory operational instability emerges;
- a Hopf-type bifurcation becomes operationally accessible;
- limit-cycle dynamics may form.

Operational interpretation:

- bifurcation accessibility indicates transition between regimes;
- this belongs to the transition layer from EDS toward EDC;
- it does not replace the primary EDS criterion.

# 14. Noise and Stochastic Operational Dynamics

Operational stochastic dynamics may be represented as:

`dX = F(X,t)dt + σdW_t`

Where:

- `σ` — stochastic fluctuation intensity;
- `dW_t` — stochastic Wiener process increment.

Operational stability becomes probabilistic.

Expected instantaneous structural balance requires:

`E[Δ(t)] > 0`

Operational interpretation:

- average structural balance may remain positive under stochastic perturbation;
- this supports formal structural existence in expected terms;
- real dynamic stability still requires endogenous structural coherence to exceed destabilizing structural pressure over operational time.

# 15. Human Operational System

Let:

`R(t)`

represent regenerative recovery resources.

Operational continuity may require:

`R(t) ≥ R_crit`

and real dynamic stability still requires:

`C(t) > P(t)`

Where:

- `R_crit` — minimum regenerative threshold required for retained operational continuity.

Operational interpretation:

- regenerative recovery may support structural stability;
- regenerative recovery does not replace endogenous structural coherence;
- real dynamic stability still requires `C(t) > P(t)`.

# 16. Final Operational Condition

A system preserves formal structural existence over an operational time horizon if:

`∫_0^T (S(t) − P(t) − D(t))dt > 0`

Accumulated positive structural work over an operational time horizon is:

`W_S(T) = ∫_0^T S(t)dt`

A system preserves real dynamic stability over time only while:

`C(t) > P(t)`

where:

`C(t)`

is the parameter of general endogenous structural coherence determining the level of structural integrity and dynamic stability over time.

Operational interpretation:

- positive accumulated structural balance supports formal structural existence;
- accumulated positive structural work may support endogenous structural coherence;
- real dynamic stability requires endogenous structural coherence to exceed destabilizing structural pressure over operational time;
- formal structural existence is not equal to dynamic stability and structural integrity over time.

# 17. Key Interpretation

Within the framework:

- `S(t)` → instantaneous intensity of synthesis of positive structural work;
- `W_S(T)` → accumulated positive structural work over operational time horizon `T`;
- `P(t)` → destabilizing structural pressure;
- `D(t)` → irreversible structural losses;
- `Δ(t)` → instantaneous structural balance supporting formal structural existence;
- `C(t)` → general endogenous structural coherence determining structural integrity and dynamic stability over time.

Formal structural existence is described by:

`Δ(t) = S(t) − P(t) − D(t)`

Accumulated positive structural work is described by:

`W_S(T) = ∫_0^T S(t)dt`

Real dynamic stability over time is described by:

`C(t) > P(t)`

Root mechanism:

decoherence of endogenous processes → reduction of regenerative capacity → dissipation exceeds regeneration → decrease of `C(t)` → disruption of dynamic stability over time.

# Constraint

All parameters and operational variables must be defined in measurable, operational, or system-relative terms within a given dynamic context.
